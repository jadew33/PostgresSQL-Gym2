How to clone and run this repo locally (code editor like vscode required) 

Using the terminal,

Clone the repo:

Navigate into the root of the repo:

cd /w22-van-the-man

Install dependencies by running: 

npm i

Navigate into the front end client folder:

cd /client

Install dependencies required by the client folder by running 'npm i' again

Should be able to start a local server now. 

Try 1, navigate back to the root from the client 'cd ..' and run 'npm run dev'

If this doesnt work, try 2, in the root start the server 'node index.js', then navigate back to the client folder 'cd client' and run 'npm start'
